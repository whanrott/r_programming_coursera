## description of a weighted mean problem by variance

The question was asked by a colleague. I don't know how to describe the statistical method required so I'm recording the question here in the hope that I'll come back to it with an answer

My colleague says
The problem: imagine you have 5 scores of one thing (A) and 5 scores for another (B) and you want to compare them.  Each of those scores has a variance/standard deviation (as it’s an average of many samples).  Each score is on a scale from 1 to 5.  In order to get a final comparison of A and B you want to add up their scores.  Is there any way that you can transfer the variance of each score down to the total? 

e.g. (HTML table coming up…)

A                             B
3 +/- 0.2               2 +/- 0.4
4 +/- 0.5               3 +/- 0.2
5 +/- 0.4               3 +/- 0.5
4 +/- 0.3               4 +/- 0.2
3 +/- 0.2               4 +/- 0.3

Overall comparison:
A= 19
B= 16

Looks like A is the winner, but is it significantly different?

That’s my problem.  Is it possible to transfer the variances/SDs/SEs to the summary figure?

I _feel_ like doing the additive thing of A=19 +/- 1.6, B=16 +/- 1.6 (therefore no sig difference) is way too simplistic and probably invalid.
